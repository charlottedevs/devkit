# DevKit

A simple wrapper for client and api for development

## Steps to get up and running
```sh
script/install
script/setup
bundle exec foreman start
```

## Development
Both `client` and `api` are separate git projects.  You are free to make changes, switch branches and push to the appropriate repo. :+1:
